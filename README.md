## Background 

The objective of this analysis is to test how the provision of an improved piped water network affects water quality and access in Beira, Mozambique. This research is part of the PAASIM Study, which examines the impact of a new piped water network on acute and chronic health outcomes among children in low-income areas of urban Mozambique. The [PAASIM study protocol](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/3/e067341#ref-89) and [pre-analysis plan](https://osf.io/4rkn6/) for the PAASIM study are published elsewhere. We assess the following specific questions: 
1. What is the impact of the intervention on and association between having a direct connection and the prevalence of any *E. coli* in source water at the final study visit? [pre-specified primary outcome of the PAASIM Study]
2. What is the impact of the intervention on water quality and access across all timepoints? [pre-specified secondary outcome]
3. What is the association between having a direct connection and water quality and access across all timepiints? [pre-specified secondary outcome]
4. What is the joint effect of living in intervention sub-neighborhoods and having a direct connection on water quality and access throughout the study period?

We hypothesized that individuals who live in sub-neighborhoods where improvements to the piped water network had been made and individuals who have a direct connection to the piped network will have better water quality and increased access compared to individuals who do not live in such sub-neighborhoods or households.
