# Introduction

**Aim 1**: to test how the provision of an improved piped water network impacts water access and quality. 

*Hypotheses*: I predict that a) individuals who live in neighborhoods with the improved piped water network and b) individuals who have a household connection to an improved water supply will have improved cwater quality and access compared to individuals who do not live in such a) neighborhoods or b) households.

The data for this analysis comes from the PAASIM “Pesquisa sobre o Acesso à Água e a Saúde Infantil em Moçambique” (PAASIM- Research on Access to Water and Child Health in Mozambique). The purpose of this project is to evaluate the impact of a new piped water network among informal settlements in the city of Beira using a matched control study design. A detailed description of the study protocol can be found here: https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/3/e067341. The pre-specified analysis plan can be found here: https://osf.io/4rkn6/. 

```{r packages, message = F, results = F, warning = F}
# CREATE PACKAGE LIST:
Packages <- c("tidyverse", "knitr", "kableExtra", "readxl", "evaluate", "boot", "table1", "broom") 

# LOAD PACKAGES:
lapply(Packages, library, character.only = TRUE)

# SUPPRESS UNHELPFUL `dplyr` MESSAGES: 
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)

```

**Packages used:**

`r Packages`

# Data

### Exposure
In brief, our intervention will be defined in two ways: 
* (1) People living in neighborhoods with the improved piped water network and 
* (2) individuals who have a household connection to an improved water supply. 

![**Figure 1.** Intervention Definitions](Figure 1_Intervention Definitions.png)

### Outcome 
We have water quality and access data from 548 households x 5 timepoints. Water quality will be defined by presence of *E. coli* (primary outcome), total coliforms, free and total chlorine, pressure, and enteropathogen data (from a subset of 100 households). We also have survey data that includes questions on satisfaction with water pressure, service, availability, and quality. Water access will be defined by the HWISE score, more information can be found here: https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/wise-scales/measure-water-insecurity/. 

```{r data import, warning = FALSE}
# Remove the `Packages` variable from your environment
rm(Packages)

data <- read_excel("../../../../../../OneDrive-SharedLibraries-EmoryUniversity/Levy, Karen - 1. PAASIM/3. Data and Analysis/Data/Blinded dataset/Cleaned/PAASIM full cleaned data.xlsx")

# # doing some simple data exploration
# head(data)
# str(data)
# View(data)

```

## Data Formatting

I filtered the master dataset to only the variables that will be used in this analysis and only to visits from households that have completed the study (study_complete). I rename variables to assist with downstream analysis. I also include code for creating a fake intervention arm/variable to use in the analysis. When we are ready to unblind, I will delete this text and the code for the false intervention variable and will update the input data file to the unblinded dataset. 

I will use visit = 1 to create all baseline variables. I dropped visit = 0 as these were only if the mother wasn't 31 weeks pregnant. These data were just used to plan future enrollment visits.

# Analysis

I briefly describe an outline of the planned analyses below. First, I will import and filter the data for variables that will be used in this analysis. I will univariately explore the associations between both levels of our intervention (household and neighborhood) and water quality and access. Following this, I will construct multivariate generalized estimating equations (GEE) to look at the association between both levels of the intervention and various water quality and access variables. 

* Table 1: Baseline differences in covariates of interest (neighborhood-level)
* Table 2: Baseline differences in covariates of interest (household-level)
* Table 3: Univariate analysis of water quality and access (neighborhood-level)
* Table 4: Univariate analysis of water quality and access (household-level)
* Table 5: Multivariate modeling of neighborhood-level intervention status and water quality and access 
* Figure 2: Plots associated with data from Table 5
* Table 6: Multivariate modeling of household-level intervention status and water quality and access 
* Figure 3: Plots associated with data from Table 6


## Data overview


## Table 1 - Baseline differences in covariates of interest (neighborhood-level)

Question - clarify with Josh that this table needs to be included because we are matching on the neighborhood-level characteristics so those vars would already be in the model
